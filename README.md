# Vokabeltrainer
> Create your own vocabulary in every preferred language and learn with it.

Vocabs are saved in a txt-file. They are read into an array. You will be
asked in random questions either in your mother or in foreign language.
If you don´t know the answer, there is a button for getting the 
solution.
